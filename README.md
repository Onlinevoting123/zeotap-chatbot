# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Features

1. Seamless Integration: The chatbot is integrated by simply embedding a script tag in the web page. It loads asynchronously and does not block the rendering of other components.
2. Full-screen Display: The chatbot is configured to display in fullscreen mode for better visibility and user interaction.
3. React Component: The chatbot is encapsulated in a React component (ChatbotEmbed) that manages the script's loading and cleanup lifecycle using useEffect.
4. Configuration: The chatbot is configured via the data-id attribute and window.chtlConfig object to specify the chatbot ID and display settings.
# Tech Stack

1. React: The application is built using React, which allows for declarative UI and efficient component management.
2. JavaScript (Vanilla): The external script is written in plain JavaScript and is loaded dynamically using createElement and appendChild.
3. useEffect: React's useEffect hook is used to handle the lifecycle of the script, ensuring the script is added when the component mounts and 
removed when it unmounts.

# How to use
1. After running the react app user need to wait for few seconds and the chatbot will be displayed on the same page.
2. User need to enter his name and then he can proceed asking questions to chatbot.
3. Below example file ensures usage of the chatbot
